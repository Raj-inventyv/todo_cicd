# Created CICD Pipeline for Nodejs to-do-list webapp using Github& jenkins Intregration

 CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

Therefore, CI/CD has been the main component of the software development cycle, with so many configurations and tools available. We will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the cloud platform, GitHub for the code repository, Jenkins for the Continuous Integration (CI), and Continuous Delivery (CD).
